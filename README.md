ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Nikitas Kostas. I am an undegraduate of Computational Linguistics (major) and Chinese Studies (minor) at Heidelberg University, Germany. For now, this page will suffice as a personal organizating blog for my (programming) studies.

# 2024
## April
- OpenAI API documentation
  - Quickstart
  - Text to Speech
- curl, nano, sox
- [Audio Data Processing in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqpSb5p1xQo)
        
- Goals for ``` in -> STT -> TTS -> out ``` Pipeline:
  - Socket streaming for Audio
  - Install all libraries in Pytorch
  - Read libraries' docs and understand them
  - Chat voice stream pipeline: Input -> GPT3 -> Out as Stream -> TTS -> Play Out as Stream
  - Commence study of OpenAI API documentation
  - [Webscraper with OpenAI](https://github.com/trancethehuman/entities-extraction-web-scraper)
  - [Webscraper with local LLMs](https://github.com/rohan-paul/LLM-FineTuning-Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Web%20scraping%20with%20Large%20Language%20Models%20(LLM)-AnthropicAI%20%2B%20LangChainAI.ipynb)

## May
- To Read|Code|Consider
  - Tool Augmented LLMs
    - [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)
  - Mini-Bot
    - [Raspberry PI Voice Assistant](https://github.com/nkasmanoff/pi-card)
  - Spiking Neural Networks + LLMs:
    - [SpikeGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13939) Make an LLM use Neuromorphic Chips ...
    - [Designing Silicon Brains using LLM: Leveraging ChatGPT for Automated Description of a Spiking Neuron Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10920) ... and let the Neuromorphic Chip be designed by the LLM it runs on.
    - [Spike-driven Transformer V2: Meta Spiking Neural Network Architecture Inspiring the Design of Next-generation Neuromorphic Chips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03663) Spoopy
  - General Stuff
    - [Interesting Papers from ICLR 2024](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2024/Conference#tab-accept-oral)
